      </h1>
      <p>
      E-commerce is the buying and selling of goods and services, 
      or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily the internet. 
      These business transactions occur either as business-to-business (B2B), 
      business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-to-consumer or consumer-to-business. 
      In the B2C model, the business is selling directly to the end-user of their product 
      or service through an e-commerce platform. This is the most popular e-commerce business model, 
      and it typically requires the least amount of time to make a sale.
