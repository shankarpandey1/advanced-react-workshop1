# Business Card Container

This code defines a `BusinessCardContainer` component that wraps around the `BusinessCard` component and adds a button to remove the business card from the page. The `BusinessCardContainer` component uses the `useState` hook to keep track of whether the business card should be displayed or not. When the "Remove" button is clicked, the `handleRemoveCard` function is called, which sets the `show` state to `false`, causing the business card to be removed from the page.

The `App` component renders a layout that includes a `Header`, `Nav`, `Main`, `Aside`, and `Footer` components. In the main content area, it also renders a list of `BusinessCardContainer` components, each with its own set of props for the name, email, and tel of the business card.
